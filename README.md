## Big Deal if push to production

Extracting information or translated text from images, also known as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and image translation, offers several benefits across various contexts and applications. Here are some of the key advantages:

Accessibility:

Language Barriers: Translates text in images to different languages, helping users understand content regardless of language.

Efficiency:

Data Entry: Automates the extraction of information from images, reducing the need for manual data entry.

Document Management: Quickly digitizes printed documents, making them easier to search, store, and manage.

Cost Savings:

Labor Reduction: Reduces the time and effort required for manual transcription and translation, lowering operational costs.

Instant Translation: Provides real-time translation of text in images, useful for travelers and in multicultural environments.
Augmented Reality (AR): Enhances AR applications by recognizing and translating text in real-time, providing contextual information.
Content Analysis:

Data Mining: Enables the extraction of valuable data from images for further analysis, such as sentiment analysis or trend detection.
